        "In this notebook, I present my completed work for the take-home assigment. I decided to fully contain my code in this notebook, because I believe it allows for my work to be more visible (not overlooked in .py files) and better showcases my step-by-step problem-solving abilities. However, in practice, I typically structure and modularize my code in the form of a package with several files like models.py, losses.py, train.py, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, I admittedly would have probably benefited from using pre-trained, open-source models, but I felt that wouldn't really demonstrate my implementation skills. Of course, these days, fine-tuning pre-trained models are the way to go, and something I always do myself for vision/language tasks; however, for point cloud data specifically, I didn't really find any open-source models that I could easily adapt in the short amount of time I had for this project, especially for the generative, diffusion-based modeling task.    \n",

The reasoning behind sampling noise from a Gaussian instead of a uniform distribution, is because it is *probably* (though I'm not certain on this) more realistic to how sensors receive noisy signals; however, other techniques of adding noise would likely also work pretty well and generate differently capable denoising models. The amount of noise that is added is controlled by a parameter $\\epsilon$, which is the standard deviation of the Gaussian, but also specifically translates to a ratio of the norm (i.e. $\\epsilon=0.01 = 1\\%$ of the norm as a distance). Also, it's important to note that randomly sampling prevents the model from fitting to certain noise patterns, which is definitely not what we want our model to learn to solve. Increasing the strength of $\\epsilon$ helps to also strengthen the model's denoising ability/robustness, but it should also be obvious that adding too much noise makes it very hard for a model to perform well, as the inputs start to become noise themselves, and may not even reflect the data seen in practice.\n",

        "Similar to other works [], I used *on-the-fly* data augmentation for sampling noisy point clouds. Dynamically augmenting the point clouds ensures that the model never fits to certain noise patterns, which is a real possibility for large transformer-based models. It could be very easy to memorize how to denoise a given point cloud, if it always is present with the same noise pattern. So this type of data \"sampling\", if you will, ensures robustness and generalizability of the denoising model, since it will always see a slightly different noise pattern for each point cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "More specifcially, during a given training iteration, each point cloud $x_i$ will receieve a random transformation while the ground truth point cloud will remain clean. So for any given training epoch (one pass over the full batch of the training set), the noisy version of a point cloud is never identical. To accomplish this, I defined a `RandomTransform` class and had to ensure the seeds were set correctly for data loading, which I will describe in the training section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, when called `RandomTransform` augments a point cloud, by first removing points according to the ratio $r$, and then adding noise according to $\\epsilon$. However, the augmentations are done probabilistically, with a probability of applying both transformations as $\\text{Pr}(\\text{both})$. If only one augmentation is applied, the functions `remove_points()` and `add_noise()` have equal probability of being called.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, with $\\text{Pr}(\\text{both})=0.5$, roughly $50\\%$ of the point clouds will receieve both augmentations, which means that $\\text{Pr}(\\text{add noise}) = \\text{Pr}(\\text{remove points}) = 0.25$. The `RandomTransform` class is very convenient, as it allows us to generate a specific kind of data distribution for each model we wish to train.\n"

        "One additional thing to note is that once points are removed from a point cloud, you will point clouds of different sizes (i.e. number of points). The PyTorch `DataLoader` will have issues with this, since it expects each example in the batch to have the same shape. Moreover, similar to language tasks where sentences can be of different lengths, we need to zero-pad the point clouds. I defined a very simple function `add_padding()`, which appends zero vectors to the point cloud. On the surface, it may seem detrimental to the denoising task, but as I will describe shortly, we can bypass our denoising model from learning features associated with these redundant padding vectors via masking.\n",

        "### Training PCDenoiser\n",
        "Now that the model architecture is outlined, we have to solve both tasks of (1) denoising point clouds and (2) completing point clouds with randomly missing points. While these can be thought of as distinct tasks, where one model could learn to denoise (e.g. denoising autoencoder) and another model solely for point completion, for simplicity, I combined both tasks. In some sense, missing points is a form of \"noise\" as it results in a lossy data point that increases the uncertainty of a classification model designed to classify a point cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, before training, we need to determine an appropriate loss function that is not only well-suited for this task, but also differentiable. This is key, as it enables us to optimize our model using gradient descent, which requires differentiability to calculate gradients and run backpropagation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Loss Function**\n",
        "We can unify both tasks with a single loss function, namely, **Chamfer Distance**. It is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$L_{CD}(P_1, P_2) = \\frac{1}{|P_1|}\\sum_{p \\in P_1} \\min_{p' \\in P_2} ||p - p'||_{2}^2 + \\frac{1}{|P_2|}\\sum_{p' \\in P_2} \\min_{p \\in P_1} ||p' - p||_{2}^2$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that I used the Euclidean distance formulation here (but $||\\cdot||_{1}$ norm is sometimes used). Given two point clouds $P_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, $P_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, it essentially measures the distance between them. Specifically, for every point in $P_1$, it measures the distance between the nearest point in $P_2$, and vice versa. One thing to consider is that efficiently implementing this loss requires an efficient method of computing nearest neighbors (e.g. using K-D trees). In order to maximize efficiency (training speed), I've shamelessly decided to utilize NVIDIA's kaolin library, as their implementation uses special CUDA-related optimizations."

I also decided to use learning rate scheduling as it also (in my experience) improves training for transformer models. I used a linear schedule for the first 10% of training steps (10 epochs) to warmup the model and a cosine annealing schedule for the remanining 90% of training steps. I found that the warmups were essential for stable training in the initial stages, otherwise the models had trouble training/converging."

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

        "It's unsurprising that the best model **pc_denoiser_1** with parameters $\\epsilon=0.01$ and $r=0$ reached the best performance. In fact, it converged relatively quickly, while the other models more or less plateaued. If we compare this model with **pc_denoiser_2** which has $r=0$, meaning point clouds were missing $50\\%$ of their points about half the time, we see that the difference in performance can be attributed to the missing points. Indeed, it does seem like point cloud completion is a much harder task to solve, and may require longer training with more careful learning rate scheduling and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, this is corroborated by the fact that the second best performing model was **pc_denoiser_3** with $\\epsilon=0.02$ and $r=0$, which seemed to still have significant room for performance, if I had extended the number of epochs to 200, for example."

            "You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
